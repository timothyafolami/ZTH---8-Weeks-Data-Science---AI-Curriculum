    "### Brief intoduction into the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Cleaning and EDA: Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in your data. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and summarizing your data to gain insights and identify patterns. Data cleaning and EDA are important because they help ensure that your data is accurate, consistent, and complete, which is essential for making informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling missing data: Missing data is a common problem in data analysis. Handling missing data involves identifying missing values and deciding how to handle them. This is important because missing data can lead to biased or inaccurate results if not handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data wrangling with Pandas: Pandas is a Python library that provides powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis. Data wrangling with Pandas involves cleaning, transforming, and reshaping data to prepare it for analysis. This is important because it allows you to work with your data in a way that is efficient and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic data cleaning exercises: Basic data cleaning exercises involve identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in your data. This is important because it helps ensure that your data is accurate, consistent, and complete, which is essential for making informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and summarizing your data to gain insights and identify patterns. This is important because it allows you to understand your data and identify relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Descriptive statistics and data visualization: Descriptive statistics and data visualization are techniques used to summarize and present data. Descriptive statistics provide information about the central tendency, variability, and distribution of your data. Data visualization allows you to present your data in a way that is easy to understand and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature engineering: Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing data to improve the performance of machine learning models. This is important because it allows you to extract more information from your data and improve the accuracy of your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduction to statistical tests using SciPy: SciPy is a Python library that provides tools for scientific computing and data analysis. Statistical tests are used to determine whether there is a significant difference between two groups of data. This is important because it allows you to make informed decisions based on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hypothesis testing and p-values: Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant difference between two groups of data. The p-value is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. This is important because it allows you to make informed decisions based on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Applying statistical concepts to data: Applying statistical concepts to data involves using statistical methods to analyze and interpret data. This is important because it allows you to make informed decisions based on your data."
